# Hyrule Monster Compendium

## Abstract:

This app was created to search through the monsters of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. You can search by name, location, favorite monsters.

## Preview of App:


## Learning Goals:

This project was meant to help increase my confidence with React, knowing when to use components, and implementing Hooks.

## Wins and Challenges:

This was my first project implementing a search feature in React. It was a lot more complicated to get rid of case sensitivity than I anticipated, and to sift through data with unexpected null properties! Writing the conditionals to search by multiple properties was a challenge, but I am proud of the way it turned out. Another challenge for me was using Router. Getting the pages to talk to each other wasnt as smooth as I would have liked, but I have grown much more comfortable and confident in my skills.
